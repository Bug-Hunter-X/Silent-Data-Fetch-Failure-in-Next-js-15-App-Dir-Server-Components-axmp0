In Next.js 15, an uncommon error arises when using the `app` directory's features with server components and concurrent rendering.  If a server component attempts to fetch data that depends on client-side information (like user preferences from cookies or browser-specific details), it will fail silently, leading to inconsistent data or unexpected behavior.  This is because server components are rendered on the server before client-side hydration, and the required client-side information isn't available during server-side rendering.
